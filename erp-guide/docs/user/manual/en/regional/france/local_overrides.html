<p>In order to be compliant with the latest finance law applicable to POS software, ERPNext automatically registers all sales and payment transactions in a chained log.</p>
<p>If your country is set to &quot;France&quot;, the deletion of sales and payment transactions will also not be permitted, even if the appropriate permissions are given to the user.</p>
<p>Please note that ERPNext is not yet fully compliant with the 2016 Finance Law.</p>
<h1 id="chained-log-report"><a class="header-link" href="#chained-log-report"></a>Chained log Report</h1>
<p>A dedicated report called &quot;Transaction Log Report&quot; is available to verify that the logged chain has not been broken.</p>
<p>If the status of the column &quot;Chain Integrity&quot; is &quot;True&quot;, the chain has not been broken.
It means that you can consult the full chain of events that occurred in your system.</p>
<p>If the status of the column &quot;Chain Integrity&quot; is &quot;False&quot;, it means that there is a discrepancy in the chain.
In this case, the previous row has been removed or altered in the database. It is a probable effect of a fraudulent behavior.</p>
