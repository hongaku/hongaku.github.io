<p><strong>Program Enrollment</strong> is the record of enrollment of a student in a given program and choose courses for a particular Academic Year and Academic Term (optional). If a student is enrolled in a program then his/her Program Enrollment must be created. The mandatory course in that program is automatically filled in Enrolled Courses table while the elective/optional courses can be selected manually.</p>
<p>If the student has applied online for the admission in a particular <strong>Program</strong> and the application is approved, then the Program Enrollment can be created from within the Student Applicant record via clicking on the <strong>Enroll</strong> button.</p>
<p>Else, to create the new Program Enrollment manually, go to:</p>

<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Student Applicant Enrollment" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/education/admission/program-enrollment.gif"></p>
<p>If any institution has skipped the online admission process then Program Enrollment can also be considered as the confirmation of the admission in a particular Program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: Academic Term is optional in the Program Enrollment. If your institution has only annual curriculum, you can skip the Academic Term</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Student Batch: To categorize student into different sections/batches, you can assign the batch to the student. On the basis of this field, later student groups can be created.</p>
<p>Student Category: For the Institutions having multiple Fees Structure, this field can be used to differentiate the student enrollment in a given fee category. </p>
