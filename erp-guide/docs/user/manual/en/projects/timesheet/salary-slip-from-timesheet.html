<p>If salary / wages for your employees are calculated based on number of hours worked, you can use Timesheet to track actual hours worked, and for creating Salary Slip.</p>
<p>####Employee creates Timesheet</p>
<p>To track actual hours employee has worked for, create Timesheet for each Employee. We suggest you to create Timesheet based on a payment period. For example, if you paying employee on a weekly bases, create one Timesheet for an Employee for one week. However, you can create multiple Timesheets, and create one Salary Slip for the multiple Timesheets.</p>

<p>####Salary Structure for the Employee</p>
<p>In the Salary Structure of the Employee, check field &quot;Salary Slip Based on Timesheet&quot;. On checking this field, you see fields Salary Component and Hour Rate. Amount for that Salary Component (say Basic) will be calculated based on:</p>
<div class=well> Total Timesheet Hours *  Hour Rate </div>

<p>Amount directly for other Salary Components (eg: House Rent Allowance, Phone Allowance) can be define directly. When creating Salary Slip, Amount for these Salary Component will be fetched as it is.</p>
