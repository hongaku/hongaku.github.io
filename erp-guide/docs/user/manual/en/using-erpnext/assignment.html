<p>Assign To feature in ERPNext allows you to allocate particular document to specific user, whom needs to further work on that document.</p>
<p>For example, if Sales Order needs to be approved/submitted by Sales Manager, first draft user can allocate that Sales Order to Sales Manager. On allocating document to Sales Manager, it will be added to that user&#39;s ToDo list. Same way, allocation can also be done to Material User and Account user who needs to create Delivery Note and Sales Invoice respectively against this Sales Note.</p>
<div class=well>Permissions restriction cannot be done based on Assigned To.</div>

<p>Following are the steps to assign document to another user.</p>
<h4 id="step-1:-click-on-the-assign-to-button"><a class="header-link" href="#step-1:-click-on-the-assign-to-button"></a>Step 1: Click on the Assign To Button</h4>
<p>Assign to option is located at the footer of document. Clicking on Assignment Icon on the tool bar will fast-forward you to footer of same document.</p>
