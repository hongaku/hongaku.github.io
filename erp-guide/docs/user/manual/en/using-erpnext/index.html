<p>We live in an era when people are very comfortable communicating, discussing,
asking, assigning work and getting feedback electronically. The Internet acts
as a great medium to collaborate on work too. Taking this concept into ERP
system, we have designed a bunch of tools whereby you can Assign transactions,
manage your To Dos, share and maintain a Calendar, maintain a company wise
Knowledge Base, Tag and Comment on transactions and send your Orders, Invoices
etc via Email. You can also send instant messages to other users using the
