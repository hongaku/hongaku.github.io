<p>ERPNext Healthcare allows you to create multiple physicians and optionally link to a User with appropriate Roles. You can create a Physician here -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Healthcare &gt; Masters &gt; Physician</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linking a User to the Physician makes the system populate the Physician field in all documents to the Physician associated with the logged in User.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: You should also relate the User to an Employee to utilize the various features of Human Resources module.</p>
