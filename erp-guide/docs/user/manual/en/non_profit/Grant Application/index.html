<p>Grant Application is designed to be used by organisations that distribute funds to others, for example grant seeker, etc.</p>
<p>Grants are non-repayable funds or products disbursed or gifted by one party (grantmakers), often a government department, corporation, foundation or trust, to a recipient, often (but not always) a nonprofit entity, educational institution, business or an individual. In order to receive a grant, some form of &quot;Grant Writing&quot; often referred to as either a proposal or an application is required.</p>
<p>Most grants are made to fund a specific project and require some level of compliance and reporting.</p>
<p>The grant writing process involves an applicant submitting a proposal (or submission) to a potential funder, either on the applicant&#39;s own initiative or in response to a Request for Proposal from the funder. Other grants can be given to individuals, such as victims of natural disasters or individuals who seek to open a small business. Sometimes grant makers require grant seekers to have some form of tax-exempt status, be a registered nonprofit organization or a local government.</p>
<p>Grant Application is grant writing process which can be review by assessment manager and then decided by the organization to disburse grant amount to the applicant or not.</p>
