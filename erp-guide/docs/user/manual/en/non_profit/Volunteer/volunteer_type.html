<p>Volunteer Types are a basic building block for Volunteering management. Typically an organization will set up a volunteer type for each of the different donation that they offer. For example, an organisation may define three volunteer types for &#39;regular&#39;, &#39;Student&#39;, and &#39;Member&#39; donor.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will cover the most common set-up for volunteer types.</p>
<p>To create new volunteer Type go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Non Profit &gt; Volunteer Type &gt; New</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Volunteer" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/non_profit/volunteer/volunteer_type.png"></p>
<p><strong>Volunteer Type:</strong> The Volunteer Type is displayed throughout the system, on both public and backend pages so spend some time thinking about a membership type name that is appropriate to both audiences. It can be changed at a later date</p>
<p><strong>Amount:</strong> If your Volunteering are free you should enter 0 (zero) in this field. Otherwise you should enter the amount that must be paid to the volunteer.</p>
