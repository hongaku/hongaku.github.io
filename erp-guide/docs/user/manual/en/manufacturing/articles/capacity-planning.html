<p>Capacity Planning functionality helps you in tracking production jobs allocated on each Workstation.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img alt="Role Desk Permission" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/articles/capacity-1.png"></p>
<p>Follow are the steps to use Capacity Planning Feature in your ERPNext account.</p>
<ol class="list">
<li><p>Operations  </p>
<p>To add operations, go to:  </p>
<p><code>Manufacturing &gt; Bill of Materials &gt; Operations</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Workstation  </p>
<p>Add each Workstation in your ERPNext account from:  </p>
<p><code>Manufacturing &gt; Bill of Materials &gt; Workstation</code> </p>
<p>In the Workstation master, you can define which operations will be performed on it, what are the cost associated with it, and what are the working hours of that Workstation.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Bill of Materials (BOM):  </p>
<p>In a BOM, with the list of raw material needed, for manufacturing, you can also list operation and workstations through which those raw materials will be processed.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Work Order:  </p>
<p>On submission of Work Order, Timesheet for Operations. This helps you allocate production jobs on each Workstation, as well as you can update actual time taken for each Operation.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="error-due-to-capacity-planning"><a class="header-link" href="#error-due-to-capacity-planning"></a>Error due to Capacity Planning</h3>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> On Submission of Work Order, we are getting following error message.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img alt="Role Desk Permission" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/articles/capacity-2.png"></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Please check if you have updated Working Hours in the Workstation master? If not, then please update it and then try to submit Work Order.</p>
<p>On submission of Work Order, Operations (as added in the BOM) are allocated on the workstation. Each operation should start and end on the same day. If a system is not able to schedule that operation in a day, then system request you to divide that Project, so that system can allocate smaller operations in a day.</p>
<p>If you have update working hours in the Workstation, but still getting this issue, that because one of your operation is taking too long, and cannot be completed in a day. Please divide that operation into smaller operations, so that it can be allocated on Workstation and completed on the same day.</p>

<p>If you want to ignore above validation and allow scheduling of production job beyond the working hours of the Workstation, enable
Overtime in the Manufacturing Settings.</p>
