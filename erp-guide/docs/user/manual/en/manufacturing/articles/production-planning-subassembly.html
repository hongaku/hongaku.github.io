<p>if you need Production Planning Tool to consider raw-materials required for the manufacturing of sub-assembly items selected in the BOM, please check following instructions to achieve the same.</p>
<p>Production Planning Tool has field called &quot;Use Multi-Level BOM&quot;, checking which will consider raw-material of sub-assemblies as well in the material planning. If this field is not checked, then it will consider sub-assembly as an item, and won&#39;t consider raw-material required for the manufacturing of that sub-assembly.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="{{docs_base_path}}/assets/img/articles/$SGrab_203.png"></p>
<p><code>Use Multi-Level BOM</code> field is also there in the Work Order and Stock Entry. If checked, raw-materials of sub-assembly item will be consumed in the manufacturing process, and not the sub-assembly item itself.</p>
