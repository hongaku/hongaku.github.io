<p>(If you are already convinced you need an all-in-one system for your
organization, you can skip this page.)</p>
<p>If you are running a small business that has a few employees, you understand
that it&#39;s hard to manage the dynamic nature of doing businesses. Small businesses
are not so different from large ones. They contain most of the complexities of
a large business along with many other constraints. Small businesses have to
communicate with customers, do accounts, pay taxes, do payroll, manage timelines,
deliver quality goods and services, answer questions, and keep everyone happy, 
just like in large businesses.</p>
<p>Large businesses have the advantage of using advanced data systems to manage
their process efficiently. Small businesses, on the other hand, typically
struggle to keep things organized. They often use a mix of apps like
spreadsheets, accounting software, web CRM etc to manage. The problem is, not
everyone is on the same page. An ERP changes that.</p>
