<p>All machines require regular maintenance, specially those that contain a lot
of moving parts, so if you are in the business of maintaining those or have
some of them in your own premises, this is a useful tool to plan a calendar of
activities for its maintenance.</p>
<p>If the Customer Issue refers to “Breakdown Maintenance”, this refers to
“Preventive Maintenance”.</p>
<p>To create a new Maintenance Schedule go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Support &gt; Maintenance Schedule &gt; New Maintenance Schedule</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Maintenance Schedule" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/support/maintenance-schedule.png"></p>
<p>In the Maintenance Schedule, there are two sections:</p>
<p>In the first section, you select the Items for which you want to generate the
schedule and set how frequently you want to plan a visit or a maintenance.
These can be optionally fetched from a Sales Order. After selecting the Items,
“Save” the record.</p>
<p>The second section contains the maintenance activities planned in the
schedule. “Generate Schedule” will generate a separate row for each
maintenance activity.</p>
<p>Each Item in a Maintenance Schedule is allocated to a Sales Person.</p>
<p>When the document is “Submitted” Calendar events are created in the User of
the Sales Person for each maintenance.</p>
