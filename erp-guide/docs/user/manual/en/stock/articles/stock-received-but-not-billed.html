<p>When purchased items are received, an accounts posting is done based on the value of the purchased items in the Stock-in-hand / fixed-assets account. When you sell and deliver those items, an expense (cost-of-goods-sold) is booked, equal to the buying cost of the items. </p>
<p>As stock balance increases through Purchase Receipt, Warehouse account is debited and an adjustment account called <strong>Stock Received But Not Billed</strong> account is credited. At the same time, the negative expense is booked in account <strong>Expense included in Valuation</strong> for the amount added for valuation purpose, to avoid double expense booking. </p>
<p>On receiving Bill from the supplier, you will make Purchase Invoice against a Purchase Receipt. Here <strong>Stock Received But Not Billed</strong> account is debited, hence nullifies the balance in the Stock Received but not Billed Account.</p>
<p>The balance in the Stock Received but not Billed account indicates the value of items for which Purchase Receipt has been made, but billing is pending.</p>
