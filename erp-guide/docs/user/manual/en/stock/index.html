<p>For most small business that deal in physical goods, a large part of their net
worth is invested in the stock in hand.</p>
<h3 id="material-flow"><a class="header-link" href="#material-flow"></a>Material Flow</h3>
<p>There are three main types of entries:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Purchase Receipt: Items received from Suppliers against Purchase Orders.</li>
<li>Stock Entry: Items transferred from one Warehouse to another.</li>
<li>Delivery Note: Items shipped to Customers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-does-erpnext-track-stock-movement-/-levels?"><a class="header-link" href="#how-does-erpnext-track-stock-movement-/-levels?"></a>How does ERPNext track stock movement / levels?</h4>
<p>Tracking stock is not just about adding and subtracting quantities. Some
complications arise when:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Back-dated (past) entries are made / edited: This affects future stock levels and may lead to negative stock.</li>
<li>Stock has to be valued based on First-in-First-out: ERPNext needs to maintain a sequence of all transactions to know the exact value of your Items.</li>
<li>Stock reports are required at any point in time in the past: You have to lookup what was the quantity / value your stock of Item X on date Y.</li>
</ul>
<p>To manage this, ERPNext collects all inventory transactions in a table called
the Stock Ledger Entry. All Purchase Receipts, Stock Entries and Delivery
Notes update this table.</p>
