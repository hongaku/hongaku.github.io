supplier. This may be on account of a number of reasons like defects in goods,
quality not matching, the buyer not needing the stock, etc.</p>
<p>You can create a Purchase Return by simply making a Purchase Receipt with negative quantity.</p>
<p>First open the original Purchase Receipt, against which supplier delivered the items.</p>
