<p>Business involves many transactional emails exchanges with parties like Customers and Suppliers, and within a company. Email Inbox feature allows you pull all your business emails into your ERPNext account. Accessing all the business emails with other transactions details makes ERPNext a single platform for accessing complete business information in one place.</p>
<p>In ERPNext, you can configure Email Inbox for each System User. Following are the detailed steps to configure Email Inbox for a User.</p>
<h4 id="step-1:-create-user"><a class="header-link" href="#step-1:-create-user"></a>Step 1: Create User</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, you can configure Email Inbox for a System User only. Hence ensure that you have added yourself and your colleagues as a User and assigned them required permissions.</p>
<p>To add new User, go to:</p>
<p><code>Setup &gt; User &gt; New User</code></p>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Email User" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/setup/email/email-user.png"></p>
<h4 id="step-2:-create-email-domain"><a class="header-link" href="#step-2:-create-email-domain"></a>Step 2: Create Email Domain</h4>
<p>To be able to send and receive emails into your ERPNext from other email service (like WebMail or Gmail), you should setup an Email Domain master. In this master, email gateway details like SMTP Address, Port No., IMAP/POP3 address details are captured. If you have ever configured a local email client (like Outlook), Email Domain master requires details to be fed in the similar way.</p>
<p>To add new Email Domain, go to:</p>
<p><code>Setup &gt; Emails &gt; Email Domain &gt; New</code></p>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Email Domain" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/setup/email/email-domain.png"></p>
<p>Once you have configured an Email Domain for your Email Service, it will be used for creating Email Accounts for all the Users in your ERPNext account.</p>
<div class=well>If you use one of the following Email Service, then you need not create Email Domain in your ERPNext account. In ERPNext, Email Domain for the following Services is available out-of-the-box and you can directly proceed to creating Email Account.
<ul class="list">
<li>Gmail</li>
<li>Yahoo</li>
<li>Sparkpost</li>
<li>SendGrid</li>
<li>Outlook.com</li>
<li>Yandex.mail</li>
<ul class="list">
</div>

<h4 id="step-3:-email-account"><a class="header-link" href="#step-3:-email-account"></a>Step 3: Email Account</h4>
<p>Create an Email Account based on the Email ID of the User. For each User who&#39;s email account is to be integrated with ERPNext, an Email Account master should be created for it. </p>
<p>If you are creating an Email Account for your colleague who&#39;s Email Password is unknown to you, then check field &quot;Awaiting Password&quot;. As per this setting, a User (for whom Email Account is created) will get a prompt to enter email password when accessing his/her ERPNext Account.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Email Password" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/setup/email/email-password.png"></p>
<p>In the Email Account, select Email Domain only if you are using Email Service other than Email Services listed above. Else, you can just select Email Service, leave Email Domain blank and proceed forward.</p>
