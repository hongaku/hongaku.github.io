<p>If your ERPNext account is hosted with us (Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd.), then you won&#39;t be able to access your ERPNext account as an Administrator. For the hosted account, access via Administrator User us reserved with us.</p>
<ol class="list">
<li><p>For the hosted account, upgrades are managed from the backend. We reserve admin login credential with us so that we can upgrade all the hosted customer&#39;s ERPNext accounts from the backend. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Since on a single server, we host have many customer&#39;s ERPNext accounts, as a security measure, we cannot share the credentials for administrator account with any hosted user.</p>
