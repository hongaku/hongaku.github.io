<p>To setup GoCardless, go to <code>Explore &gt; Integrations &gt; GoCardless Settings</code></p>
<h2 id="setup-gocardless"><a class="header-link" href="#setup-gocardless"></a>Setup GoCardless</h2>
<p>To enable GoCardless in your ERPNext account, you need to configure the following parameters and Access Token and optionally (but highly recommended), a Webhooks Secret key.</p>
<p>You can setup several GoCardless payment gateways if needed. The choice of payment gateway account will determine which GoCardless account is used for the payment.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="/docs/assets/img/setup/integrations/gocardless_account.png" alt="GoCardless Settings"></p>
<p>On enabling service, the system will create a Payment Gateway record and an Account head in chart of account with account type as Bank.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="/docs/assets/img/setup/integrations/gocardless_coa.png" alt="GoCardless COA"></p>
<p>It will also create a payment gateway account. You can change the default bank account if needed and create a template for the payment request.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="/docs/assets/img/setup/integrations/payment_gateway_account_gocardless.png" alt="Payment Gateway Account"></p>
<p>After configuring the Payment Gateway Account, your system is able to accept online payments through GoCardless.</p>
<h2 id="sepa-payments-flow"><a class="header-link" href="#sepa-payments-flow"></a>SEPA Payments Flow</h2>
<p>When a new payment SEPA payment in initiated, the customer is asked to enter his IBAN (or local account number) and to validate a SEPA mandate.</p>
<p>Upon validation of the mandate, a payment request is sent to GoCardless and processed.</p>
<p>If the customer has already a valid SEPA mandate, when instead of sending a payment request to the customer, the payment request is directly sent to GoCardless without the need for the customer to validate it.
The customer will only receive a confirmation email from GoCardless informing him that a payment has been processed.</p>
<h2 id="mandate-cancellation"><a class="header-link" href="#mandate-cancellation"></a>Mandate cancellation</h2>
<p>You can setup a Webhook in GoCardless to automatically disabled cancelled or expired mandates in ERPNext.</p>
<p>The Endpoint URL of your webhook should be: <a href="https://yoursite.com/api/method/erpnext.erpnext_integrations.doctype.gocardless_settings.webhooks">https://yoursite.com/api/method/erpnext.erpnext_integrations.doctype.gocardless_settings.webhooks</a></p>
<p>In this case do not forget to configure your Webhooks Secret Key in your GoCardless account settings in ERPNext.</p>
