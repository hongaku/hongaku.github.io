<p>The admission process begins with filling the admission form. The Student Admission record enables to initiate your admission process for a given <strong>Academic year</strong>. ERPNext admission module allows you to create an admission record which can be then published on the ERPNext generate website.</p>
<p>To create a Student Admission record  go to :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>education</strong> &gt; <strong>Admissions</strong> &gt; <strong>Student Admission</strong> &gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Student Applicant" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/education/admission/student-admission.gif"></p>
<p>Once an admission record is created, the age eligibility criteria can be determined for the every program. Similarly, you can also determine the application fee and naming series for every student applicant. If you keep the naming series blank then the default naming series will be applied for every student applicant.</p>
<p>The information provided in the Student Admission records will be used for the validation and creation of the Student Admission records (only if student admission link is filled there)</p>
