<p>The Program Enrollment tool allows the bulk enrollment of the new and old students in a Program. If you are enrolling a new student, you  can fetch the students from the <strong>Student Applicant</strong> or if you are promoting the older students you can fetch them from the <strong>Program Enrollment</strong> itself</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Academic Term is optional in the Program Enrollment Tool</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can create the Program Enrollment for :</p>
<ol class="list">
<li><strong>Student Applicants</strong>: List of Student Applicants will be fetched for the selected <strong>Program</strong>, <strong>Academic year</strong> and <strong>Academic Term</strong> (if provided). </li>
</ol>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Student Applicant Enrollment" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/education/admission/program-enrollment-tool.gif"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Program Enrollment</strong>: List of students already enrolled in selected <strong>Program</strong> for the given <strong>Academic Year</strong>, <strong>Academic Term</strong> (if provided) and <strong>Student Batch</strong> will be fetched and can be used to enroll students from one academic year/term to another in the same <strong>Program</strong> or a new <strong>Program</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Student Applicant Enrollment" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/education/admission/program-enrollment-tool01.gif"></p>
<p><strong>New Student Batch</strong>: This can be selected for the entire students fetched in the table. Priority will be given to the Batch selected in the table (for individual students).</p>
<p>For promoting the students, the new academic year, academic term and program can also be selected for the enrollment of the fetched students list.</p>
