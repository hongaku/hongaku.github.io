<p>Sometimes employees go outside for company&#39;s work and company pays some amount for their expenses in advance. In that time, the employee can create Employee Advance form and the expense approver can submit the advance record after verification. After Employee Advance gets submitted, the accountant releases the payment and makes the payment entry.</p>
<p>To make a new Employee Advance, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HR &gt; Employee Advance &gt; New Employee Advance</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Expense Claim" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/human-resources/employee_advance.png"></p>
<p>Set the Employee ID, date, purpose and requested amount and “Save” the record.</p>
<h3 id="employee-advance-submission"><a class="header-link" href="#employee-advance-submission"></a>Employee Advance Submission</h3>
<p>Employee Advance record can be created by any employee but they cannot submit the record. </p>
<p>After saving Employee Advance, Employee should <a href="/docs/user/manual/en/using-erpnext/assignment.html">Assign document to Approver</a>. On assignment, approving user will also receive email notification. To automate email notification, you can also setup <a href="/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/email/email-alerts.html">Email Alert</a>.</p>
<p>After verification, approver can submit the Employee Advance form or reject the request.</p>
<h3 id="make-payment-entry"><a class="header-link" href="#make-payment-entry"></a>Make Payment Entry</h3>
<p>After submission of Employee Advance record, accounts user will be able to create payment entry via Journal Entry or Payment Entry form.

<h3 id="adjust-advances-on-expense-claim"><a class="header-link" href="#adjust-advances-on-expense-claim"></a>Adjust advances on Expense Claim</h3>
