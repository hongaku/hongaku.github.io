<p>A shareholder is any person, company or other institution that owns at least one share of a companyâ€™s stock. Because shareholders are a company&#39;s owners, they reap the benefits of the company&#39;s successes in the form of increased stock valuation. If the company does poorly, however, shareholders can lose money if the price of its stock declines.</p>
<p>A shareholder is uniquely identified by the Shareholder ID. Normally this ID is a naming series, starting with <code>SH-</code>. Also as soon as the Shareholder makes even a single transaction, a Folio number is allocated to him. This also is a unique to the Shareholder.</p>
<p>You can directly create your Shareholders via</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accounts &gt; Shareholder</p>
