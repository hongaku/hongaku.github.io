<p>You can define which <a href="/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/setting-up-taxes.html">Tax Template</a> must be applied on a Sales / Purchase transaction using Tax Rule.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Tax Rule" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/accounts/tax-rule.png"></p>
<p>You can define Tax Rules for Sales or Purchase Taxes. 
While making a Transaction the system will select and apply tax template based on the tax rule defined.
The system selects Tax Rule with maximum matching Filters.</p>
<p>Let us consider a senario to understand Tax Rule Better.</p>
<p>Suppose we define 2 Tax Rules as below.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Tax Rule" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/accounts/tax-rule-1.png"></p>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Tax Rule" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/accounts/tax-rule-2.png"></p>
<p>Here Tax Rule 1 has Billing Country as India and Tax Rule 2 has Billing Country as United Kingdom</p>
<p>Now supposed we try to create a Sales Order for a customer whose default Billing Country is India, system shall select Tax Rule 1.
In case the customers Billing Country was United Kingdom, the system would have selected Tax Rule 2.</p>
