<p><strong>Question:</strong> On saving the Purchase Invoice, I am getting a validation message that Credit To Account must be a Balance Sheet account.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img alt="Role Desk Permission" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/articles/purchase-invoice-account-type.png"></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>On submission of a Purchase Invoice, payable is updated towards the Supplier. As per the accounting standards, Payable Account is aligned under Current Liability (credit side of Balance Sheet).</p>
<p>The error message indicates that Account selected in the Credit To field doesn&#39;t belong to the Liability Group. Please ensure that Payable Account selected in the Purchase Invoice is located under Liability group.</p>
