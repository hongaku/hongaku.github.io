<p>As per the party model, a common receivable account called <strong>Debtor</strong> is auto-created. This is a default Receivable Account for all the Customers.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img alt="Role Desk Permission" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/articles/common-receivable.png"></p>
<p>If needed, you can also create a new receivable account and update in the Customer master.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Should I create separate Receivable Account Account for each Customer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can, but it&#39;s not a recommend approach. If you want to create separate Receivable Account for each Customer for tracking receivable, then it not needed. You still view Account Receivable &amp; General Ledger report for each Customer.</p>
<p>Just like Debtors, for tracking payables, default account called Creditors is created under Account Payables.</p>
