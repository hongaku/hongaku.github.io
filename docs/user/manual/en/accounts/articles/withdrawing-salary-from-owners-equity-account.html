<h3 id="question"><a class="header-link" href="#question"></a>Question</h3>
<p>After meeting with my accountant here in the US, I was informed that with my company being a sole member, I should not pay myself a salary that would hit the direct expenses account but instead should take a &quot;draw&quot; that hits the balance sheet and not the expenses. Can you please advise how I should set this up in ERP Next please?</p>
<h3 id="answer"><a class="header-link" href="#answer"></a>Answer</h3>
<ol class="list">
<li>Create an account for <strong>Owner&#39;s Equity</strong> under Liabilities if you already do not have. This account will be your investment in the business and the accumulated profits (or losses). It will have a &quot;Credit&quot; type balance.</li>
<li>In an Version 5, Equity will be a new head (not under Liabilities). (In either case Assets = Owner&#39;s Equity + Liabilities, so your balance sheet will be okay <a href="http://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/what-is-owners-equity">Learn more about owner&#39;s equity account</a>).</li>
<li>Create an account for <strong>Owner&#39;s Draws</strong> under <strong>Owner&#39;s Equity</strong>.</li>
<li>Note that the balance of <strong>Owner&#39;s Draws</strong> will always be negative since you are reducing money from your total equity / profits.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header-link" href="#example"></a>Example</h3>
<p>Example journal entry (using Journal Voucher in ERPNext) for a withdrawal of $1000 would be:</p>
<ol class="list">
<li>Credit <strong>Cash</strong> $1000</li>
<li>Debit <strong>Owner&#39;s Draws</strong> $1000</li>
</ol>
