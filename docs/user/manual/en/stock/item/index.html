<p>An Item is your companys&#39; product or a service. The term Item is applicable to things (products or services) you sell as well as raw materials or components of products yet to be produced (before they can be sold to customers). An Item can be a physical product or a service that you buy/sell from your customers/suppliers. ERPNext allows you to manage all sorts of items like raw-materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods, item variants and service items.</p>
<p>ERPNext is optimised for itemised management of your sales and purchase. If you are in services, you can create an Item for each services that your offer. Completing the Item Master is very essential for successful implementation of ERPNext.</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Item Name:</strong> Item name is the actual name of your product or service.</li>
<li><strong>Item Code:</strong> Item Code is a short-form to denote your Item. If you have very few Items, it is advisable to keep the Item Name and the Item Code same. This helps new users to recognise and update Item details in all transactions. In case you have lot of Items with long names and the list runs in hundreds, it is advisable to code. To understand naming Item codes see <a href="/docs/user/manual/en/stock/item/item-codification.html">Item Codification</a></li>
<li><strong>Item Group:</strong> Item Group is used to categorize an Item under various criterias like products, raw materials, services, sub-assemblies, consumables or all Item groups. Create your default Item Group list under Setup&gt; Item Group and pre-select the option while filling your New Item details under <a href="/docs/user/manual/en/stock/setup/item-group.html">Item Group</a></li>
<li><strong>Default Unit of Measure:</strong> This is the default measuring unit that you will use for your product. It could be in nos, kgs, meters, etc. You can store all the UOM’s that your product will require under Set Up&gt; Master Data &gt; UOM. These can be preselected while filling New Item by using % sign to get a pop up of the UOM list.</li>
<li><strong>Brand:</strong> If you have more than one brand save them under Set Up&gt; Master Data&gt; Brand and pre-select them while filling a New Item.</li>

<p>To upload an image for your icon that will appear in all transactions, save the partially filled form. Only after your file is saved  the &#39;upload&#39; button will work above the Image icon. Click on this sign and upload the image.</p>
<h3 id="inventory-:-warehouse-and-stock-setting"><a class="header-link" href="#inventory-:-warehouse-and-stock-setting"></a>Inventory : Warehouse and Stock Setting</h3>
<p>In ERPNext, you can select different type of Warehouses to stock your different Items. This can be selected based on Item types. It could be Fixed Asset Item, Stock Item or even Manufacturing Item.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Stock Item:</strong> If you are maintaining stock of this Item in your Inventory, ERPNext will make a stock ledger entry for each transaction of this item.</li>
<li><strong>Default Warehouse:</strong> This is the Warehouse that is automatically selected in your transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Allowance Percentage:</strong> This is the percent by which you will be allowed to over-bill or over-deliver this Item. If not set, it will select from the Global Defaults.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="serialized-and-batched-inventory"><a class="header-link" href="#serialized-and-batched-inventory"></a>Serialized and Batched Inventory</h3>
<p>These numbers help to track individual units or batches of Items which you sell. It also tracks warranty and returns. In case any individual Item is recalled by the supplier the number system helps to track individual Item. The numbering system also manages expiry dates. Please note that if you sell your items in thousands, and if the items are very small like pens or erasers, you need not serialize them. In ERPNext, you will have to mention the serial number in some accounting entries. To create serial numbers you will have to manually create all the numbers in your entries. If your product is not a big consumer durable Item, if it has no warranty and has no chances of being recalled, avoid giving serial numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: While entering an item code in an items table, if the table requires inventory details, then depending on whether the entered item is batched or serialized, you can enter serial or batch numbers right away in a pop-up dialog.
