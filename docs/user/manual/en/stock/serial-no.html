<p>As we discussed in the <strong>Item</strong> section, if an <strong>Item</strong> is <em>serialized</em>, a
<strong>Serial Number</strong> (Serial No) record is maintained for each quantity of that
<strong>Item</strong>. This information is helpful in tracking the location of the Serial
No, its warranty and end-of-life (expiry) information.</p>
<p><strong>Serial Nos</strong> are also useful to maintain fixed assets. <strong>Maintenance Schedules</strong> can also be created against serial numbers for planning and scheduling maintenance activity for these assets (if they require maintenance).</p>
<p>You can also track from which <strong>Supplier</strong> you purchased the <strong>Serial No</strong> and
to which <strong>Customer</strong> you have sold it. The <strong>Serial No</strong> status will tell you
its current inventory status.</p>
<p>If your Item is <em>serialized</em> you will have to enter the Serial Nos in the
related column with each Serial No in a new line.
You can maintain single units of serialized items using Serial Number.</p>

<p>Inventory of an Item can only be affected if the Serial No is transacted via a
Stock transaction (Stock Entry, Purchase Receipt, Delivery Note, Sales
Invoice). When a new Serial No is created directly, its warehouse cannot be
set.</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>The Status is set based on Stock Entry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only Serial Numbers with status &#39;Available&#39; can be delivered.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Serial Nos can automatically be created from a Stock Entry or Purchase Receipt. If you mention Serial No in the Serial Nos column, it will automatically create those serial Nos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If in the Item Master, the Serial No Series is mentioned, you can leave the Serial No column blank in a Stock Entry / Purchase Receipt and Serial Nos will automatically be set from that series.</p>
