Item, based on the current stock levels and other requirements. It is the
quantity of gross inventory that includes supply and demand in the past which
is done as part of the planning process.</p>

point and to determine the reorder quantity. The projected Quantity is used by
the planning engine to monitor the safety stock levels. These levels are
maintained to serve unexpected demands.</p>
