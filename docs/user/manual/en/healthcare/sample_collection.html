<p>It&#39;s critical for a Laboratory to manage collected samples and you may want to ID the sample, print stickers etc. ERPNext Healthcare &quot;Sample Collection&quot; document helps you to easily manage the sample collection process by creating a sample collection document for every Lab Test automatically. You will have to turn on the flag in Healthcare Settings to enable this feature.</p>

<p>You will have to enter the sample collected date and time to Submit the document signaling that the sample is collected.</p>
<p>Printing on sample identification tags is also possible. By default a sample sticker print template is made available, but you can always create a custom Print Format by using &quot;Customize&quot; button in the print preview.</p>
