<p>To get the customer through the door, you may be doing all or any of the
following:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Listing your product on directories.</li>
<li>Maintaining an updated and searchable website.</li>
<li>Meeting people at trade events.</li>
<li>Advertising your product or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you send out the word that you are around and have something valuable to
offer, people will come in to check out your product. These are your Leads.</p>
<p>They are called Leads because they may lead you to a sale. Sales people
usually work on leads by calling them, building a relationship and sending
information about their products or services. It is important to track all
this conversation to enable another person who may have to follow-up on that
contact. The new person is then able to know the history of that particular
Lead.</p>
<hr>
<p>Leads are the  entities constituting a first contact. Leads can be created by a system users or by a web-user. When a lead is created minimal info (name,email) is entered and the lead is (default) linked to the active system user, the owner of the lead  A user configurable drop list is used to classify Status of the lead (Open, Replied etc)</p>
<p>To create a Lead, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CRM &gt; Lead &gt; New Lead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ERPNext gives you a lot of options you may want to store about your Leads. For
example what is the source, how likely are they to give you business etc. If
you have a healthy number of leads, this information will help you prioritize
who you want to work with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> ERPNext makes it easy to follow-up on leads by updating the “Next
Contact” details. This will add a new event in the Calendar for the User who
has to contact the lead next.</p>

<p>A Lead is a potential Customer, someone who can give you business. A Customer is an
organization or individual who has given you business before (and has an Account
in your system). A Contact is a person who belongs to the Customer.</p>
<p>A Lead can sometimes be an organization you are trying to make a deal with. In this case you can select &quot;Lead is an Organization&quot; and add as many contacts within this organization as you want.
It is useful if you are establishing a relationship with several people within the same organization.</p>
<p>A Lead can be converted to a Customer by selecting “Customer” from the <strong>Make</strong>
dropdown. Once the Customer is created, the Lead becomes “Converted” and any
further Opportunities from the same source can be created against this
Customer.</p>

<h3 id="creation-via-portal"><a class="header-link" href="#creation-via-portal"></a>Creation via Portal</h3>
<p>If a someone creates an account through the website interface is Lead is automatically created, status is Open and the Owner is the webuser.</p>
<p>After registration the webform Addresses is called, where the web user can enter address information.The address is linked to the lead using the <strong>Lead Name-Address Type</strong> as ID.</p>
<p>If using the Cart functionality, items are ordered the Lead is Converted and a Customer is created using the Web-User Name. Because a Customer can only be linked to a webuser using the (foreign) ID in Contact, such contact has to be created as well.</p>
