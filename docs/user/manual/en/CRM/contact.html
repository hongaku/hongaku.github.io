<p>Contacts do not need to be linked to another document, they can be stand alone.  You can even create a contact with only a first name, not linked to any other document or party (Customer/Supplier).</p>
<p>The Contact_ID is automatically created:</p>
<ol class="list">
<li>If only a First Name is entered that First Name defines the ID , thus First name (only)</li>
<li>If a First Name and a Party is linked the ID becomes “FirstName-Party”</li>
</ol>
<p>Contacts can, but do not have to be linked, to:  User, Customer, Supplier, and Sales Partner. Since Customers and Addresses are not directly linked to a User, all links go via Contacts.</p>
<p>A Contact can be linked to the (web) user. If that user is also a Customer, it is linked to the Customer by the Customer ID</p>
<p>Contacts and Addresses in ERPNext are stored separately so that you can
attach multiple Contacts or Addresses to Customers and Suppliers.</p>
<p>To create a new Contact go to,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CRM &gt; Contact &gt; New</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Contact" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/crm/contact.png"></p>
<p>Or you can add a Contact or Address directly from the Customer record, click on “New
Contact” or “New Address”.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Contact" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/crm/contact-from-cust.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: When you select a Customer in any transaction, one Contact and Address
gets pre-selected. This is the “Default Contact or Address”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To Import multiple Contacts and Addresses from a spreadsheet, use the Data
Import Tool.</p>

<h3 id="address-titles"><a class="header-link" href="#address-titles"></a>Address Titles</h3>
<p>The Address Title (Name of person or organization that this address belongs to) is a free format unlinked field. The ID is automatically created from the Address Title and Address Type. (AddressTitle-AddressType).</p>
<h3 id="address-linking"><a class="header-link" href="#address-linking"></a>Address Linking</h3>
<p>Addresses can be entered individually (unlinked)  or linked to customers, leads, suppliers or Sales Partners. </p>
<p>Linking is done in the reference section where the links can be established.</p>
