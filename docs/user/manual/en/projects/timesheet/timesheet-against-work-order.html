<p>Creating Timesheet for Work Order helps in capacity planning for the Workstations. Also it helps in tracking actual time consumed the Workstation for completing specific operation.</p>
<p>When a Work Order is submitted, based on the Planned Start Date and the availability of the Workstations, system schedules all operations by creating Timesheet.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume we are manufacturing a mobile phone. As per the Bill of Material, time required for the assembly of components could be one hour. However the actual time taken for it&#39;s completion could be more than planned. The actual time tracking provides actual operation cost, hence helps in determining accurate valuation of the manufacturing item.</p>
<p>####Work Order</p>
<p>As per the Bill of Materials of manufacturing item, following are the Operations and Workstation through which raw-material items are processed.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="Sales Invoice" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/project/timesheet/timesheet-work-order-1.png"></p>
<p>On submission on Work Order, Timesheet will be created automatically.</p>

<p>####Time Sheet created from Work Order</p>
<p>In the Timesheet, unique row will be added for each Operation - Workstation. This allows operator/supervisor at the workstation to enter actual From Time and To Time taken for each Operation.</p>

<p>With updating actual time, you can also enter &quot;Completed Qty&quot;. If all the items are not processed in the same Timesheet, you can create another Timesheet from the Work Order.</p>
