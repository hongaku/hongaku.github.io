<p>ERPNext helps you manage your Projects by breaking them into Tasks and
allocating them to different people.</p>
<p>Purchasing and selling can also be tracked against Projects and this can help
the company keep tabs on its budget, delivery and profitability for a Project.</p>
<p>Projects can be used to manage internal projects, manufacturing jobs or
service jobs. For service jobs, Time Sheets can also be created that can be
used to bill Customers if billing is done on a Time &amp; Money basis.</p>
