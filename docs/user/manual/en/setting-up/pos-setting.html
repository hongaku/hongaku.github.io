<p>POS includes advanced features to cater to different functionality, such as
inventory management, CRM, financials, warehousing, etc., all built into the
POS software. Prior to the modern POS, all of these functions were done
independently and required the manual re-keying of information, which could
lead to entry errors.</p>
<p>If you are in retail operations, you want your Point of Sale to be as quick
and efficient as possible. To do this, you can create a POS Setting for a user
from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accounts &gt; Setup &gt; Point-of-Sale Profile</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Set default values as defined.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img class="screenshot" alt="POS Setting" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/pos-setting/pos_profile.png"></p>
<p>To set the default mode of payment, enabled the option default in the mode of payments table
<img class="screenshot" alt="POS Setting" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/pos-setting/default_mop.png"></p>
<p>User can sale the particular products to the particular customers from the POS by adding item groups, customer groups in the POS Profile.

<blockquote>
<p>Important : If you specify a particular User, the POS setting will be
applied only to that User. If the User option is left blank, the setting will
be set for all users. To understand POS in detail visit <a href="/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/point-of-sale-pos-invoice.html">Point of Sale</a></p>
