<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have added my Employee as a User and have assigned them Roles as well. Still, they are not able to view Dashboard on the login.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>There are two type of Users in ERPNext.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><strong>System User</strong>: They are Employees of your company. Example of Roles assigned to System Users are Account User, Sales Manager, Purchase User, Support Team etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Website User</strong>: They are to parties (like Customer and Suppliers) of your Company. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example Website User Roles are Customer and Suppliers.</p>
<p>How to check if Role is for System User or Website User?</p>
<p>In the Role master, if field &quot;Desk Access&quot; is checked, that Role is for System User. If Desk Access field is unchecked, then that Role is for Website User.</p>
