    <article class="markdown-body"><p><strong>Question:</strong> User has roles like Account User and Account Manager assigned. Still, when accessing  Account Receivable report, User is getting an error message of no permission the territory master.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img alt="Report Permission Error" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/articles/report-permission-1.png"></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>As per the permission system in ERPNext, for the User to be able to access a form or a report, s(he) should have at-least read permission on all the link field in that form/report. Since Territory is a link field in Account Receivable report, please add a permission rule to let Account User/Manager have at-least Read permission on the Territory master. Please follow below-given steps to resolve this issue.</p>
<ol class="list">
<li><p>Roles assigned to User are Account User and Account Manager.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>As indicates in the Error message, the user didn&#39;t have permission on the territory master. As per the default permission, none of the above role assigned to that User has any permission on the Territory master.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>To resolve this issue, I have assigned Account User permission to Read Territory master.  </p>
<p class="img-container"><img alt="Permission Manager" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/articles/report-permission-2.png"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As per this permission update, User should be able to access Account Receivable report fine.</p>
