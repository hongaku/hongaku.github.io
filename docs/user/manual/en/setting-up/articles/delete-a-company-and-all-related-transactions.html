<p>Often, users setup all the master data and then create a few dummy records. Then they want to delete the dummy records and the company and start over again, keeping the other master data like Customers, Items, BOMs intact.</p>
<p>Version 5 onwards, you can now delete all dummy transactions related to a company.</p>
<p>To do that, open the company record.</p>
<p><code>Setup &gt; Accounts &gt; Company</code> or  <code>Accounts &gt; Setup &gt; Company</code></p>
<p>In Company master, click on the <strong>Delete Company Transactions</strong> button right at the bottom of the form. Then you must re-type the company name to confirm if you are sure you want to continue with this.</p>
<p>This action will wipe out all the data related to that company like Quotation, Invoices, Purchase Orders etc. So be careful</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to delete the company record itself, use the normal &quot;Delete&quot; button from Menu options. It will also delete Chart of Accounts, Chart of Cost Centers and Warehouse records for that company.</p>
